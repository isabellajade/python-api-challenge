## Module 6 Challenge
For this project I analyzed the weather of nearly 600 randomly generated cities in order to find out if their location could be influencing the cities weather. 

## Summary
Below are the final visualizations that compare the different latitudes of randomly selected cities with their temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 

## Latitude Vs Temperature

## City Map
Below is a map of all of the randomly generated cities. Each colored dot is a new city and the size of the dot is representative of the city's humidity.

## Ideal Weather Map
Below is a map of cities filtered to have ideal weather conditions. Added to the hover message on the interactive map is the name of the nearest hotel as well as the country the city is located in.
